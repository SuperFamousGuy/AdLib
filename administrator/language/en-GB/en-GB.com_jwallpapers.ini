DISPLAY_MODE_EXPLAIN_CLASSIC=This mode represents the classic gallery presentation scheme where only direct children (pictures and categories) of a given node (category) are displayed as thumbnails inside their parent. This scheme is both scalable regarding the amount of pictures and categories. This mode should be definitely be used for galleries with a considerable amount of categories.
DISPLAY_MODE_EXPLAIN_JWALLPAPERS=This mode was introduced by JWallpapers in order to provide a new level of simplicity where pictures of a given node (category) and those of their children (subcategories) are displayed all together. Going deeper in the category tree acts like a filter by displaying only pictures that belongs to the current branch. This scheme is scalable regarding the number of pictures, but performance decreases linearly with the number of categories (since each branch needs to be dynamically constructed when a given node is requested). This mode can be used for light to medium range category lists. The classic display mode should be preferred for galleries with lots of categories.
